ff_grind

A map that is at the moment work in progress based around a dynamic arena that changes shape every two minutes (might later change it to some other condition), the idea was inspired by the Cybergrind from ULTRAKILL.
Skybox is packed in this repository. Taken from ff_vidars. A sound of a train rolling is used in the map, taken from Neotokyo by Studio RADI-8. An edit of the logo of IKEA is used.
